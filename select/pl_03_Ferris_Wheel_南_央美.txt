August in the heat
Sweaty in the street
Tilt-a-whirling
I can feel your eyes
Find me in the crowd
Think you like me now
I've been seeing you everyday
On my block in your white tee
You're looking pretty fine to me
So why are you waiting?
When I'm slamming
in my dancing shoes
Asphalts hot
and my knees all bruised
It's the summer
gotta lot to prove
Can't wait to do it can you?
(NO!)
Oh,
I'm swaying from side to side
In the neon lights
Sainted halo underworld
goth vibes
You'll do fine for tonight
Take me, take me, me
Ferris Wheeling, babe
It's the air I crave
When we're up so high
Salty wind at night
Make out mountain time
I've been seeing you everyday
On my block in your white tee
You're looking pretty fine to me
So why are you waiting?
When I'm slamming
in my dancing shoes
Asphalts hot
and my knees all bruised
It's the summer
gotta lot to prove
Can't wait to do it can you?
(No!)
Oh,
I'm swaying from side to side
In the neon lights
Sainted halo underworld
goth vibes
You'll do fine for tonight
You'll do fine for tonight
You'll do fine for tonight
I've been seeing you everyday
On my block in your white tee
You're looking pretty fine to me
So why are you waiting?
I've been seeing you everyday
On my block in your white tee
You're looking pretty fine to me
So, so why are you waiting?
When I'm slamming
in my dancing shoes
Asphalts hot
and my knees all bruised
It's the summer
gotta lot to prove
Can't wait to do it can you?
(No!)
Oh,
I'm swaying from side to side
In the neon lights
Sainted halo underworld
goth vibes
You'll do fine for tonight
You'll do fine for tonight
You'll do fine for tonight
