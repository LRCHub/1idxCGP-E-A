You've been so excited
for this weekend
And I've been working
overtime to pretend
You say you love
the swing ride the best
But look at that dude
with the sketchy tattoo
on his chest
He's been in the hot sun all day
Running heavy duty machinery
No fear in your eyes,
they're just sparkling
You're ready to ride
and I'm scared I might die
With you at the
top of a Ferris wheel
Being here conquers a fear
I think as we kiss
If the bench would fall
This moment's worth
it risking it all
All the upset stomachs
when I was young
Puking on the zipper
and graviton
It's too late now for me
to back down
I don't want to ruin
or damper the moment
While screaming inside
Why aren't we home yet.
With you at the top
of a Ferris wheel
Being here conquers a fear
I think as we kiss
If the bench would fall
This moment's worth
it risking it all
With you at the top
of a Ferris wheel
Being here conquers a fear
I think as we kiss
If the bench would fall
This moment's worth
it risking it all
Now I see what you mean
Look at the way the sky
Turns purple above the green
Far back in the clearing
This feels like a dream
Sitting with you at the top
This moment's worth
it risking it all
With you at the
top of a Ferris wheel
Being here conquers a fear
I think as we kiss
If the bench would fall
This moment's worth
it risking it all
With you at the
top of a Ferris wheel
With you at the
top of a Ferris wheel
This moment's worth
it risking it all
